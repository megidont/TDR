# TDR - Tweaks, Destructables, and Randomness

As you may be able to guess from the commit history, this repository used to be for a top down roguelike mod of Quake. This wasn't as fun as I wanted it to be, and so I decided to take this repo in a new direction while keeping the same name. Hence, TDR is now Tweaks, Destructables, and Randomness.

Shout outs to nopy4869 still apply.

## Tweaks:

Honestly, the main ones right now have to do with random ammo and health drops. I also made gibbing enemies not exclude them from dropping a backpack.
TODO: Give individual entities custom death messages if possible.

## Destructables:

Destructable walls have been implemented.
TODO: Make wall gib take texture of the wall if possible
TODO: Make wall gib quantities based on volume of wall object

## Randomness:

Random wall objects (regular and destructable), random weapon objects, and random enemy spawns are all implemented.
TODO: give individual entities their own drop tables (eg. "shambler or vore" "super shotgun or nailgun" "any weapon")
