# TDR - Top Down with Roguelike Elements

This branch - Legacy - Represents the final state of the original intent of this project. I intend to abandon my previous intentions, and continue development with some of the features I have added - namely destructable walls and random item and enemy spawns - while disabling top down by default. I will try not to break compatibility with top down, but as it is antithetical to many things that make Quake fun I intend to almost entirely abandon it and take this mod in a different direction.
